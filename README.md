A rich Asana client written in Meteor, planned features are TimeTracking, Budgeting, Statistics and Reporting.
I really like Asana, and I love Meteor.js, so I figured I could try and write a client that adds some features to the standard Asana app.
This is still very experimental. Its my first Meteor application and Meteor is still in beta. So go figure.

Features:
Log in with your asana account
Synchronize your tasks with asana
Time tracking functions on tasks.
Admin function: list users and see what they are working on.

Road Map:
Detailed Work Statistics and Work Load Visaulization using D3
Manage Estimated Time on Tasks vs Actual Worked Time
Add alerts when overworking a task.
Add Hourly Cost on Users and budget functions

Contributions are welcome.
